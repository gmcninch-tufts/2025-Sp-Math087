# Schedule & Format

- **Professor: **[George McNinch](http://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu)
  <<george.mcninch@tufts.edu>>

- There is no required textbook for the course. I will post notes --
  usually in the form of `jupyter notebooks` on the course web site
  (you can find a link to the site on Canvas).


# Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}

*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*

Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets* (homework),
three *quizzes*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). [Here is the
  planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math087--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope] -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).

- 3 *quizzes*

  There will be three in-class quizzes which are intended to assess
  your comprehension of the material. I'll 

- 2 *midterm reports* and 1 *final report*

  Note that you will submit a *proposal* for the final report prior to work.

Please refer to the [rubric and
expectation](/course-posts/resources--expectations-and-rubrics.html) for further
remarks concerning these course components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component  | percentage |
|:-----------------|:-----------|
| problem sets     | 40%        |
| quizz total      | 15%        |
| midterm report 1 | 15%        |
| midterm report 2 | 15%        |
| final report     | 15%        |

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
