# Math 087 - Mathematical Modelling


## Schedule & Format

- **Professor: **[George McNinch](http://gmcninch.math.tufts.edu)
  <<george.mcninch@tufts.edu>>

- There is no required textbook for the course. I will post notes --
  usually in the form of `jupyter notebooks` on the course web site
  (you can find a link to the site on Canvas).


## Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}

*You should keep up with the posted material throughout the  course!!*

Your grade in the course will be based on  *problem sets* (homework),
two *quizzes*, two *midterm reports* and a *final report*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Since the class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays, problem sets will
  be collected weekly on *Fridays* (some weeks, a midterm report --
  see below -- will instead by collected on Friday). [Here is the
  planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math087--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  A total of 10 problem sets will be collected.

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope] -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html).

- 2 *quizzes*

  There will be two in-class quizzes which are intended to assess
  your comprehension of the material. 
  
  These will take place on Wednesday Feb 26 & Wednesday April 2.
  
  I'll provide details of what will be assessed.

- 2 *midterm reports* and 1 *final report*

  Note that you will submit a *proposal* for the final report prior to
  work.  Moreover, there will be a *video component* to your final
  project. After the final projects are collected, you must watch (at
  least) two videos created by classmates and write a brief summary of
  them. These summaries will be due during the final exam period (on
  the schedule day of the final exam for the class).

  Here are the dates:
  
  - midterm report 1 --2025-02-14 
  - midterm report 2 -- 2025-03-14 
  - final report proposal due -- 2025-04-04 
  - final report due -- 2025-04-25
  - final report - peer comments -- 2025-05-02 

Please refer to the course website where you will find more detailed
description of expectations concerning these course
components.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading
components by the following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component        | percentage |
|:-----------------------|:-----------|
| problem sets (average) | 40%        |
| quizzes (average)      | 15%        |
| midterm report 1       | 15%        |
| midterm report 2       | 15%        |
| final report           | 15%        |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
