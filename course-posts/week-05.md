This week, you have a *midterm report* due on Sunday. It concerns a
*network flow* problem, like those we saw [last week](week-04.html).
Last week, I actually didn't discuss a second network flow example (it
was in the notebook but I didn't talk about it in the lecture), so I
may spend a bit of time discussing that in Monday's lecture.
