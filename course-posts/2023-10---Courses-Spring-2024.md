The first is [Math 087 *Mathematical Modeling*](/course-assets/2025-spring--Math087-MathematicalModelling.pdf).
  
As some practical information, for code use I'll mostly use *python*
together with various scientific computing libraries (numpy, scipy,
pandas, ...), and I plan to use *jupyter notebooks* both in the
lectures and for course notes. There are some more details in the
course description (the link above).
